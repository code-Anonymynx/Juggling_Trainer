# Juggling_Trainer
Beginnings of a long term project to build a Juggling Trainer app.

_**This is my SECOND piece of code... and the beginning of my FIRST long-term project.**_

**First Steps**:

I have chosen to start writing this in Julia. This is for probably not very good reasons, but I'll share anyway. 

- I like the emojis.
- I share a name with the code.
- The logo reminds me of juggling balls and this code is for a juggling trainer.
- I've JUST started learning this language.
- I don't know why not to yet.

That asside - I've started with the very basics just to get something written. I've developed a little index of tricks I know and assigned them with difficulty levels. (This is based on my own juggling skill level at the moment). 

From that, I was able to create a few simple drill lists, based on how difficult I will find it. 
I decided to asign emojis to each list so I can choose based on how I'm feeling that day. 


**Ideas and Things to Develop**:

- I'd _like_ to create a nice UI that asks me how I'm feeling today and auto prints the appropriate lists.
- Populate it with more content
- Build most lists
- Organise the tricks into different catagories
- Create an input to track no# drops per trick, per session
- Look at some data over time - **especially interested** to see how good I am at guessing my "mood to juggling ratios" over time
